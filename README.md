PROJECT DESCRIPTION: ExpressionCompiler is a straightforward yet powerful C++ project designed to parse and evaluate basic arithmetic expressions, offering a practical demonstration of compiler construction concepts in a simplified environment. The project focuses on implementing the core components of a compiler—lexical analysis, parsing, and evaluation—without the overhead of advanced language features, making it an ideal learning resource for beginners and an efficient utility for those needing quick mathematical expression evaluation. The compiler accepts arithmetic expressions containing integers, basic operators such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/), as well as parentheses for grouping operations to control precedence. At its core, ExpressionCompiler reads the input expression as a string, processes it into tokens during lexical analysis, interprets these tokens to form a structured representation of the expression during parsing, and finally evaluates the result based on operator precedence and associativity rules. The lexical analyzer scans the input character by character, classifying sequences into meaningful units—numbers, operators, and parentheses—while ignoring whitespace for flexible input formatting. Once tokenized, the parser takes over, constructing either a parse tree or applying algorithms such as the Shunting Yard method to convert the expression into postfix notation for easier evaluation. This parsing stage ensures that the compiler correctly understands the intended order of operations, such as prioritizing multiplication and division over addition and subtraction, and respecting parentheses that alter this order. The evaluation stage then traverses the parsed structure or processes the postfix sequence, performing calculations step-by-step to produce the final numeric result, which is displayed to the user. Error handling is also an important aspect of ExpressionCompiler, with mechanisms in place to detect and report invalid expressions, such as unmatched parentheses, unsupported characters, or division by zero, ensuring that the tool is robust and user-friendly. While the project’s primary focus is on basic arithmetic, its modular design makes it highly extensible—developers can add support for additional operators, floating-point numbers, unary operators, or even variables and functions with minimal changes to the codebase. The simplicity of the code allows it to serve as a stepping stone toward understanding more complex compiler architectures, such as those used in general-purpose programming languages. From an educational perspective, ExpressionCompiler provides hands-on experience with concepts like lexical tokenization, parsing algorithms, abstract syntax trees, operator precedence handling, and runtime evaluation—topics that are often abstract in theory but become clear when implemented in a tangible project. Its design also promotes good programming practices, such as separation of concerns between different compiler stages, clean code organization, and clear documentation for maintainability. The project runs efficiently on standard hardware without requiring specialized dependencies, making it portable and easy to integrate into other applications or run in lightweight environments. Common use cases include evaluating mathematical formulas entered by a user in a larger software system, serving as a backend calculation engine for a simple calculator application, or acting as a teaching aid in programming and computer science courses focused on compilers and interpreters. In summary, ExpressionCompiler is more than just a small programming exercise—it’s a functional and extensible tool that captures the essence of compiler design in a compact, approachable form. By blending clarity, functionality, and extensibility, it stands as both a useful utility for arithmetic evaluation and a valuable learning project for anyone interested in the fundamentals of language processing and compiler theory.
